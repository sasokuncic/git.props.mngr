Other data are set regarding to the type of subscriber: - Analog & ISDN Subscribers: just Area Code and the Directory Number should be defined   Example: 04-2072730   04-2072623 ... - SIP Suscriber: In the case when the Supplementary Service Set, Call Server Address, Domain Name and/or the Identification Alias should also be updated, these data are also defined.   Example: 04-2072730    supplServiceSet=15 domainName=null identAlias=null   04-2072623    supplServiceSet=14 domainName=null identAlias=null  ... - MGCP Subscriber: also IP Address and Domain Name should be defined.   Example: 04-2072730   172.18.241.142   [172.18.241.142]   04-2072623   172.18.241.136   mg1.iskratel.si ...	=SUM(C3339:AH3339)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
